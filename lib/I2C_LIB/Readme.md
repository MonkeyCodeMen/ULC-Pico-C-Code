* The I2C_slave and I2C Master provides some wrapper class to establish an I2C connection between 
 * two Arduino devices. Where one Arduino system take the master role and the (one or more) other Arduino
 * systems take the slave role
 * 
 * Two "connection modes" are implemented :
 * 1) stream
 * 2) Registerbank
 * 
 * features:
 * +) Thread safe implementation 
 * +) Classes designed in Arduino begin/end  and loop style
 *     no need for user to deal with ISR and/or callbacks
 * +) statistics implemented 
 * +) up to three I2C bus per slave supported at same time 
 *     no limits on master side
 *     mix on of slave / master possible for one Arduino system
 * +) mainly based on TwoWire ==> portable
 * +) 0 Bytes / Transfer rqeuest (in stream mode of no new data from slave)
 * 
 * negatives:
 * -) double (stream) / trible (Register) buffering consums a lot of memory
 * -) not performance optmizied 
 * -) limited to 240 data bytes (buffer and transfer)
 * -) ring buffer size for stream mode must be adjusted in driver header
 * ==> in the applications where I'm short on memory or the focus is on high datarate, I use for the ÂµController spezalised 
 *       drivers (Without two wire lib) and utilze DMA transfers
 * 
 * utilized Arduino LIB's:
 * +) communication based on TwoWire  (portable)
 * +) RingBuf (for stream connection)
 * 
 * 
 * basic architecture:
 * 
 * Stream:
 * =======
 * 
 * your application is dealing with I2C_master / I2C_slaveStream objects only
 * 
 * on master side the complete communication chain is been blocking
 * this means if you call a read or write action, the class method will
 * only return after all data is send / received or an error (timeout) has been occured
 * 
 *  +------------+      +------------+      #################
 *  |            |      |            |      #               #---------SCL----------   
 *  | I2C_master |<====>| TwoWire::  |<====># Arduino HW    #
 *  | ---------- |      | Wire       |      #               #---------SDA----------
 *  |            |      | ----       |      #################
 *  +------------+      +------------+
 * 
 *  so it is an pretty easy straight forward handling
 *  the stream is now designed to simply transfer bytes (unsigned char / uint8_t) to and from the slave
 *   
 *  like above mentioned on master side it is blocking procedure, nevertheless the TowWire Lib
 *  works with a buffer (typically 32 bytes). So the I2C frames are limited to 32 Bytes. But the I2C_master 
 *  object split longer frames to smaller chuncks and send them all without releasing the bus (for possible oher master)
 * 
 * on slave side the data is been double buffered.  


 /**
 *  \class I2C_Slave_8Bit
 *  \ingroup I2C
 *  \brief implements a thread save I2C slave with IN / Write and OUT / Read register ... restricted by wire lib, there can be only one I2C_Slave_XBit per Arduino I2C interface
 *
 *  this class implements the communication part of an I2C slave device 
 *  it provides IN (master write) and OUT (master read) regsiter (with shadowbuffers) as bus<=>application interface   
 *  class takes care if register set is above 32 bytes (buffer size of wire.h) ans split transfers than to multiple frames
 *  
 *  it utilize the arduino Wire lib 
 *  it is written in the Arduino "Style"  with setup and loop function 
 *
 *  1) somewhere you should craete an object of this class:
 *     \snippet  I2C_Slave slave;
 *     \snippet  #define I2C_SLAVE_ADR 0x33
 *
 *   2) configure your slave 
 *      \snippet void setup() {
 *      \snippet    delay(2000);
 *      \snippet    Serial.begin(115200);
 *      \snippet    
 *      \snippet    slave.setup(I2C_SLAVE_ADR,REG_WIDTH_32_BIT,2,2);
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *  the class provides "dirty" functionality, means you can ask if any data or a special register has been modified since th elast loop run
 *  memory consumption
